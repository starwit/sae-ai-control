# SAE AI Control

This is a repository to select detection results and transfer the selected results to ai-cockpit.

# How-to start

## Check prerequisites
In order to work with this repository, you need to ensure the following steps:
- Install Poetry
- Install Docker with compose plugin
- Clone main SAE repository (you will most likely need a running SAE to do anything useful): https://github.com/starwit/starwit-awareness-engine

## Setup
- Run `poetry install`, this should install all necessary dependencies
- Start docker compose version of the SAE (see here: https://github.com/starwit/starwit-awareness-engine/blob/main/docker-compose/README.md)
- Run `poetry run python main.py`. If you see log messages like `Received SAE message from pipeline`, everything works as intended.

## Configuration
This template employs pydantic-settings for configuration handling. On startup, the following happens:
1. Load defaults (see `config.py`)
2. Read settings `settings.yaml` if it exists
3. Search through environment variables if any match configuration parameters (converted to upper_snake_case, nested levels delimited by `__`), overwriting the corresponding setting
4. Validate settings hierarchy if all necessary values are filled, otherwise Pydantic will throw a hopefully helpful error

The `settings.template.yaml` should always reflect a correct and fully fledged settings structure to use as a starting point for users. 

## Github Workflows and Versioning

The following Github Actions are available:

* [PR build](.github/workflows/pr-build.yml): Builds python project for each pull request to main branch. `poetry install` and `poetry run pytest` are executed, to compile and test python code.
* [Build and publish latest image](.github/workflows/build-publish-latest.yml): Manually executed action. Same like PR build. Additionally puts latest docker image to internal docker registry.
* [Create release](.github/workflows/create-release.yml): Manually executed action. Creates a github release with tag, docker image in internal docker registry, helm chart in chartmuseum by using and incrementing the version in pyproject.toml. Poetry is updating to next version by using "patch, minor and major" keywords. If you want to change to non-incremental version, set version in directly in pyproject.toml and execute create release afterwards.

## Dependabot Version Update

With [dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) a scheduled version update via Dependabot is configured. Dependabot creates a pull request if newer versions are available and the compilation is checked via PR build.
